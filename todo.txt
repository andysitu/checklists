chart.addData should also check if +
   this.dataObj[type][name][this.year + "_" + this.month]
   already exist. If so, handle it.

menu.createMenu needs to automatically create rows & columsn &
   the second column should all be given a class (by class list, not replacing it)
   of "submit_value"

Disallow user from creating row with same name & type as previously
   created one
